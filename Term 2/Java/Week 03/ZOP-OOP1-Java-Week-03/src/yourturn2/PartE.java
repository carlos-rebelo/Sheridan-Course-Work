        String string2 = new String("Hello"); //but this is what the compiler really does!  (Strings are objects!)

        //These are the same.  Notice that we didn't have to import String like we did for Random - That is because String is in the java.lang package which the compiler automatically looks for - Can you think of another class that you use A LOT that must be in that package?

        //⁡⁢⁣⁢Here is my challenge to you⁡...Prove that String is actually a class and not a primitive

        /* ⁡⁢⁢⁢Hint 1 -⁡ click here =>
            -printing out the variable won't work like it does with the rnd reference variable because Java will just print out the text stored in the String

                what can we do with reference variables that we can't do with primitives?  You know...  DOT DOT DOT!
