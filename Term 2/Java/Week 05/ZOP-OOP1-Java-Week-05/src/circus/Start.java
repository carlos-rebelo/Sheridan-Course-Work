        //OK, let's write the instructions to build an empty Cage  object and ask the JVM to instantiate a Cage object for us!

        //ok, but what do we use cages for in a zoo?

        //Let's add some code to our Cage to allow us to 'hold a reference' to an Animal

        //Ok, let's  mess around with stuff and watch it through the debugger

        // Instantiate an Animal that is a BEAR

        //Put the BEAR in a CAGE

        //Now do it all in one line

        //Back to slides

        //⁡⁢⁣⁢Part B⁡ - What prints???  Let's try some stuff

        //Cage cage1 = new Cage(new Animal(AnimalType.BEAR));
        // Cage thinkOfWhatIHold = cage1;

        //⁡⁢⁣⁢Part C⁡ - Let's add an array into the mix!

        //Let's build an Animal that is a LION and assign it to the reference variable animal1
        //Let's build a Cage, assign  animal1 to it, and assign it to the reference variable cage1

        //Now let's build an empty array of Cages
