        //make your r4 Robot pick up the Thing that is 5 spaces in front of it, and move it 5 more spaces before dropping it. Hint - you might want to explore the methods in Robot that have Thing in their name

        //r5 is to do the same thing as r4 but, this time, you don't know where the Thing might be.  Can you pick up and move the Thing to column 10?
