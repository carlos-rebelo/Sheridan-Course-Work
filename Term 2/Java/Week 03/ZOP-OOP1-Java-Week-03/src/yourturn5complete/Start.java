Write a class called AreaCalculator that:

    has a method called printOutFormulas that will accept no arguments, return no value, but will print out the following:
            Area of Rectangle = length * width
            Area of Square = length * length
            Area of Circle = PI *radius *radius 
            Area of Triangle = .5*base * height

    has a method called areaOfRectangle which will accept two doubles: length and width, and will RETURN the area of the rectangle to the calling class

    has a method called areaOfSquare which will accept a single double (length) and will return the area of the square

    has a methodcalled areaOfCircle which will accept a double (radius) and will return the area of the circle

    has a method called areaOfTriangle that will accept a double for the base and a double for the height and will return the area of the triangle

    Finally, Instantiat an AreaCalculator in the main method below and test out all of your methods!

        AreaCalculator calc = new AreaCalculator();
        calc.printOutFormulas();
