 Write a class that models a particular type of animal (Maybe a Lion or a Dog or a Parrot...whatever kind of animal you like)   

What should you call your class?  (We should probable name it after the animal type it represents) 

    -   Make an instance variable called name that can hold the animal’s name. 
    -  Make a method called makeNoise that will print out whatever noise the animal makes.  For instance, a Dog object would print “bark!” 2. Now, write a class called Testing with a main method and instantiate two of your Animals with different names. 

Run your program. 

Make both Animal objects make a noise. 

Change your code in the makeNoise method so that when your animal makes a noise, it will also print out the animal’s name:  “Aiko says bark!”.  Notice that you didn’t need to make any changes in the Testing Class for this to work. 

Run your program. 

Now that you've made an animal class and instantiated it, make a Student Class with a name instance variable, a student number instance variable and a gradePercent instance variable  

Now, add a method to the Student Class that will allow the student to study (print out <name> is studying) 

Next, add code to the main method of the Testing class that will instantiate two student objects and  make them each study. 

 Finally, change your code so that when you call the study method, you can pass a String value representing what subject they are studying so that the method prints out <name> is studying <subject>.  
    For example, 
        Rich is studying Computer Science.  

Now, write a Professor class with a name instance variable.  Next, give the professor the ability to teach  a particular subject that you will pass to the teach method. 
        Professor Rich is teaching Computer Science). 
        
        Now instantiate a Professor object in your main method and make it teach.
