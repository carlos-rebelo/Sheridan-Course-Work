        //Ok, but what if I type 'durp' into the textbox?

        //This is an Exception.  The people that wrote Integer.parseInt protected their code from bad data...This is what we must do with our code!

        //Can we fix this with a try/catch?

        //can we use a loop to keep asking?

        //Hmmm...would this be good to move to a static method in a Utils class?
