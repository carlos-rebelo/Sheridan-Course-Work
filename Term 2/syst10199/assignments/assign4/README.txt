2. Open folder in VS Code. Make sure you are in the Assign4 directory that contains
controllers, models, views, etc. If you are not directly in the Assign4 directory it will not work

4. In your browser, go to localhost:3000, you will see an error message. that is fine.

5. Now, based on the operation you want to do, write the url localhost:3000/operation/num1/num2

7. Replace num1 and num2 with the numbers you want to perform the operation on

8. Example 1: localhost:3000/add/2/2 is equal to 2 + 2

9. Example 2: localhost:3000/subtract/20/10 is equal to 20 - 10
